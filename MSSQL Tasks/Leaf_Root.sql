--You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

--Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

--Root: If node is root node.
--Leaf: If node is leaf node.
--Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.

select n,
case 
when p is null then 'Root' 
when n not in (select distinct p from bst where p is not null) then 'Leaf' 
else 'Inner' 
end
from bst 
order by n;
